# Project Description
Mythology Trivia is a game that test your knowledge about Mythology. You decide the number of Mythology questions that you want, and the app would get those questions from a free API called Open Trivia Database. You would then have a preview of the questions with answers included. After you are ready to play, you will see each question individually and you can click one of the choices provided. 

## Preview Of Questions
After you decide how many questions you want, the program is going to show you in a popup window all the questions with all the possible answers, the answer on the right side of the question is the correct answer. 

## Guessing Questions
Every time you click on an answer choice, the correct answer would turn green to let you know which choice was the correct answer. The incorrect answers would turn red to let you know that those answers are incorrect. There are 4 choices but only 1 correct answer.

## Trivia Review
After guessing all of the questions, you are going to have 20 seconds to review your trivia results. After the 20 seconds, it would tell you if you won or lost the game.

## Win Condition
You win if you get correct at least half of the total number of questions.

## Future Improvements
In the future, I would love to add animations and sound to make it more fun and unique.
