# Project Description
It's a game that test your knowledge about Mythology. You decide the number of Mythology questions that you want, and the app would get those questions from a free API called Open Trivia Database. You would then have a preview of the questions with answers included. After you are ready to play, you will see each question individually and you can click one of the choices provided. 

## Win Condition
You win if you got correct at least half of the total number of questions. Every time you click on an answer, the correct answer would appear at the bottom of the choices so you can know which was the correct answer. 

## Future Improvements
In the future, I would love to add animations to make it more fun and unique.
